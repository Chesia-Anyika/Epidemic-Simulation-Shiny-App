## Epidemic Simulation Shiny App

This Shiny application provides an interactive platform to simulate the spread of an epidemic using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). It incorporates:

- **Agent Dynamics**: Simulating individual biological and psychological states throughout disease progression.
- **Social Network Interactions**: Modeling contagion through networks like households, schools, and workplaces.
- **Epidemic Progression Visualization**: Tracking infection rates, immunity development, and critical outcomes over time.

The app enables users to explore how disease spreads and evolves within a community, factoring in behavioral responses and interaction networks.
